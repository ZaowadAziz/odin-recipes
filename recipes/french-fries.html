    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Use your trusty air fryer to make these irresistible French fries.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon kosher salt</li>     
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut each potato lengthwise into 3/8-inch-thick slices, then slice sections into 3/8-inch-wide sticks. Place potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Let soak to release excess starches, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Pour boiling water over the potatoes until they're covered by a few inches. Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer onto some paper towels. Blot off excess water and let cool completely, at least 10 minutes.r</li>
        <li>Place cooled potatoes in a mixing bowl. Drizzle with oil and season with cayenne; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stack potatoes in a double layer in the fryer basket.</li>
        <li>Cook for 15 minutes. Slide basket out and toss fries. Continue frying until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Toss fries with salt in a mixing bowl. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
